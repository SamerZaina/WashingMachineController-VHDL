# WashingMachineController-VHDL
A VHDL-based Finite State Machine (FSM) implementation of a programmable washing machine controller. The system manages washing, rinsing, and spinning cycles, uses clock division for timing control, and displays system states on a seven-segment display. Designed and simulated using Intel Quartus Prime.
